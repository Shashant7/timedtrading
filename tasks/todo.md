## Backlog

### Earnings Verification (pre-secondary-check)
- [ ] **Finnhub debug** — Hit `GET /timed/earnings/upcoming?debug=1` to see raw Finnhub response for NFLX, TSLA, AAPL. Compare with public calendars.
- [ ] **TwelveData secondary** — Debug response now includes TwelveData earnings_calendar for same range. Compare `check_tickers_finnhub` vs `check_tickers_twelvedata`. If Finnhub has false positives, gate bubble-chart dashed ring on TwelveData confirmation.

### Emails
- [ ] **Contact Emails** — Centralize support@timed-trading.com, legal@timed-trading.com, and any others (Terms §17, VAPID subject, footer/nav). Ensure consistency across all surfaces.
- [ ] **Welcome Email** — Trigger on signup/subscription.
- [ ] **Reminder Emails** — Re-engagement (e.g., unused features, inactive users).
- [ ] **Transactional / Alert Notifications** — Email delivery for trade alerts, system notifications, etc.
- **Plan:** See `tasks/EMAIL_PLAN.md` for sending (Resend/SendGrid/etc.) and receiving (support/legal + optional inbound parsing).

### Daily Brief
- [ ] **News feed** — Extend beyond `fetchAlpacaEconNews` (economic/macro); add general market news section or broader news source for brief enrichment.

- **Backfill for Backtest** [2026-02-27] — alpaca-backfill now accepts startDate/endDate to target the backtest range. full-backtest.sh backfills from 60 days before start (EMA warm-up) through end.

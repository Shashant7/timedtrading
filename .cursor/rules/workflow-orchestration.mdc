# Workflow Orchestration

Follow `tasks/WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATION.md`. Key principles:

## Plan Mode Default
- Non-trivial tasks (3+ steps): write plan to `tasks/todo.md` first
- If something goes sideways: STOP and re-plan, don't push through

## Verification Before Done
- Never mark complete without proving it works
- "Would a staff engineer approve this?"

## Self-Improvement
- After user corrections: update `tasks/lessons.md`
- Review lessons at session start

## Core
- Simplicity first. Minimal impact. No temporary fixes.

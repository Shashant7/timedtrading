      <h2>4. Algorithm and Technology Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        The Service uses proprietary algorithms, scoring models, and data processing systems. You acknowledge and accept the following inherent limitations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Historical Data Dependency:</strong> Scoring models are trained on and process historical data. They may not reflect current market conditions, unprecedented events, or future trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Errors, Biases, and Inaccuracies:</strong> Algorithms may produce errors, contain biases, generate inaccurate analyses, or provide incomplete information. No algorithm is infallible.</li>
        <li><strong>No Guarantee of Accuracy:</strong> We make no representations or warranties about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of any score, signal, analysis, or data presented on the Platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Market Changes:</strong> Financial markets change faster than algorithms can adapt. Real-time data may be delayed, and scores may not reflect the most current market state.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Data Limitations:</strong> The Platform relies on third-party data sources (including market data providers) that may contain delays, errors, omissions, or inaccuracies. We are not responsible for the quality or availability of third-party data.</li>
        <li><strong>System Availability:</strong> The Platform may experience downtime, interruptions, latency, or technical failures at any time without notice.</li>
      </ul>
